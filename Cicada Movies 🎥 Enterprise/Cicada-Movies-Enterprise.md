🎥 About Cicada Movies Enterprise

Cicada Movies 🎥 Enterprise is the cinematic division of Cicada 3301 Corporations, focused on producing visionary films, series, and multimedia art rooted in African mysticism, cyber intelligence, divine archetypes, and esoteric history.

We blend high-concept mythology with digital storytelling—fusing the sacred, the cryptographic, and the cinematic. Our productions empower communities, honor ancestral knowledge, and create new lanes for black excellence in sci-fi, historical epics, and divine drama.

🎬 What We Do:

Produce original films and miniseries

Document esoteric and ancient African truths

Build AI-generated storyboards and scripts

Manage actor networks and casting

Host choreography sessions for sacred performance

Partner with spiritual leaders, dancers, and directors globally
