Cape Town, South Africa â€“ A hijacked building located at 179 Loop Street, formerly operating as the Happy Rhino Hotel, has become the epicenter of a rising criminal syndicate allegedly operated by foreign nationals.

According to reports, the building is currently under the illegal control of two men known only by their street names: Bush and Batista, who are allegedly responsible for a range of violent crimes, including extortion, drug trafficking, sexual assault, and physical intimidation of residents. The men are reportedly demanding fraudulent rent payments from vulnerable tenants, many of whom are undocumented, unemployed, or in hiding due to threats.

Witnesses say the building has become a lawless enclave, functioning outside legal oversight while some residents live in fear of daily abuse. A disturbing incident was reported on 23 May 2025, when a young woman emerged from the building injured and bleeding, claiming she had been sexually assaulted by Bush after refusing to comply with his illegal rental demands. Despite calls to law enforcement, the suspect was not arrested at the time, sparking public outrage.

Multiple community members allege that local law enforcement may have been bribed or intimidated, as the suspect has been reported several times without any conclusive legal action taken. The building is described by tenants as a "prison run by criminals," where drug sales, violent threats, and exploitation occur unchecked.

Community activists are now calling for urgent intervention by national police units, anti-corruption agencies, and housing officials to shut down the operation, arrest the alleged perpetrators, and restore legal order to the building and its surroundings.

As the story unfolds, CapeXBin will continue monitoring developments, including any responses from SAPS, the Hawks, and relevant housing authorities.
