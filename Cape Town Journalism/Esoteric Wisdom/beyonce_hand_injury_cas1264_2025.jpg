Image Description

This image(see on main) captures the aftermath of a violent incident involving a young 
woman known only as Beyoncé, who suffered a physical injury during an alleged 
extortion and rape attempt at the hijacked Rhino Hotel on Loop Street 179, Cape Town. 
The photo clearly depicts Beyoncé's left hand, visibly bleeding from a deep laceration 
sustained during a confrontation with an alleged Congolese extortionist known as “Bush.”

The wound appears fresh, with blood actively trailing from the center of the palm and fingers.
Her hand is slightly trembling, suggesting shock or trauma. The injury reportedly occurred on May 23, 2025, 
the same day a criminal case was opened (SAPS Ref: CAS 1264/5/2025) by community whistleblowers.
According to witnesses, Bush had allegedly forced his way into her rented room, demanding fraudulent rental 
payments, and then violently attacked her when she resisted.

This image stands as visual evidence of the physical harm inflicted and is tied directly to allegations of 
ongoing gender-based violence, extortion, and building hijacking by individuals named Bush and Batista,
operating with impunity inside the Rhino Hotel building. The photograph was taken shortly after the incident, 
prior to any professional medical treatment, emphasizing the urgency and brutality of the attack.
